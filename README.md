# CS7641_Assignment1
Jupyter notebooks and Datasets for the assignment 1


For this assignment, I used Jyputer. There is 1 Jupyter notebook and 1 csv file for each dataset 

Dataset #1 files:
    ionosphere.ipynb
    ionosphere.csv

Dataset #2 files:
    seismic.ipynb
    seismic.csv

To run the code, download the files into a directory and execute the 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' command.
Open the appropriate notebook and run the cells starting from the top.
